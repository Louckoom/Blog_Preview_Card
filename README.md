## My process

- First i build the HTML create divs into specific order.
- Then i import the font in HTML using "Link".
- Then i create the CSS file and link with the HTML file.
- Then i begin fill elements style with color and font.
- Then i use flexbox to align elements and have correct spacing.
- Finally i adjust some minor details to be as same as possible of the original design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

- I want to learn more about layout and responsive design.

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/#fr) - This helped me for using properly flexbox.
